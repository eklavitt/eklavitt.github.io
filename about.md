<p>I am Elliott Klavitter. Born in Portland, Oregon, raised in the woods by wolves, vagabond at heart yet homebody by nature; I am not a robot. Solving puzzles is attractive, which draws me to writing code. I read, surf, create with my hands, explore processes of thought, study social dynamics, and thrive on positive connection with everyone around. My middle name is COOPER, and I can fly.</p>
