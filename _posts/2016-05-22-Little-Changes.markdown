## Summary:

I've been slacking on updating my github. This doesn't mean I haven't been improving my skills though, only irresponsible on making sure the activity is shown. 

### What have I been doing?

- Quit using Codecademy, and started using CodeSchool.
- Began learning JavaScript
- Took a step back to review the basics.

I want to start doing projects for others soon. Luckily, I have a few projects in mind, aside from my own, that can start my portfolio. Although I am a person who likes to be thrown to the wolves, this time I want to be a little more prepared. This is a new environment for me, and I would rather not get discouraged from the start. 

The reason I quit Codecademy was due to a bit of dis-interest. After trying CodeSchool, I found it much more engaging. Returning to the basics of html and CSS, it's teaching me a lot that wasn't covered before, so I am happy with my decision. 

This week, I want to be really working with JavaScript. I guess that's my goal, and it is fully attainable.
