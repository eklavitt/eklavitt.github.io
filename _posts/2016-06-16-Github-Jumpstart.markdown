## Summary:

Although my github activity has been less than sparce over the last few weeks, I have been working hard on my web development skills. I didn't forget about the importance of "Code Every Day," and have been doing at least every few days. My focuses over the last few weeks:

#### Design Fundamentals:
* Simplicity!!!
* Color Schemes and their Psychology
* Using Images as Layout
* Proper use of Multiple Typefaces
* Readability with Responsive Design

I find that design with UX/UI in mind comes fairly natural with my attention to detail, and my passion in Sociology. It's fascinating how people react to the smallest details, without being aware they're affected. At the same time, the thoughtfulness that is necessary to have a perfectly affective webpage could very easily become overlooked. Fortunately, I have the patience, and mild OCD, to work in this realm, and am excited to study more. 

In addition to taking codeschool courses, watching videos and reading articles on the design aspect, I purchased Sketch App for my primary tool of web design. After thorough research, it seemed the best choices were this and Photoshop. Difinitively, [Sketch](http://www.sketchapp.com/) is the better choice with the intention of web development, and the price was plenty worth it. 

#### jQuery:
* Traversing the DOM
* Variables
* Functions
* Listening and Calling
* Animate!

Having learned a bit about Javascript, and how it creates interaction between the user and the site, jQuery wasn't too difficult to catch on to. It is simply a library of actions I can implement to make my site more interesting, and although it is in the creative/style realm, it defines important functions crucial to UX/UI.  

### Conlusion:

I am still an absolute novice in the sport of web development. I have only just begun to create my own first project, less than 3 months from beginning my journey. Excited to be starting from absolute scratch, I am worried I am not quite prepared. Honestly, I know I am not quite prepared, since I have only done assignments by codeschool and codecademy, watched many videos, taken many notes, and tried to retain it all. What I do know is that I'm ready to gain the experience it takes to dive into this new world. My skills and knowledge have improved ten fold. My comfort level with HTML, CSS, jQuery, sublimetext, the terminal, Github is as good as it's been, but will only improve with use. I know the basics, and it's time to practice. 

### Weekly Goal:

I want to finish a mock website this week. I have started a few basic files, and a new Github repo to work within. This is my jumpstart to Github activity, once again. I will write at least one more blog post this week on my trials and tribulations, and send as many commits as possible. It is, once again, about holding myself accountable. As they say..."Code Every Day."
