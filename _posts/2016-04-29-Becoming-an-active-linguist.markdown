## Summary:
	
Keeping myself active in Github is seemingly one of the most important pieces in becoming a desired web developer. I feel my HTML skills are strong, CSS nearly the same, and Bootstrap essential. I don't have to learn everything at once, since the level of care and quality will result in comparable success. But, I do need consistent activity.

Practicing through various projects is the only way to be fully skilled (i.e. experience!). With daily practice, I can stay fresh. It's no different than the other languages I've learned, and surely my competence will fade without continual use just the same.

### My focus for this week:

- Continue mastery of HTML and CSS
- Continue learning Bootstrap
- Familiarize myself with all the uses of Github
- Complete Codecademy projects
- Personalize my Github profile
- Daily Updates


It doesn't seem unreasonable for me to do all of these. I need to hold myself accountable.
